    // Advanced Functions
    const array = [1, 2, 10, 14];
    const double = [];

    // forEach only iterates through arrays; it does not return value 
    const newArray = array.forEach((num) => {
      double.push(num *2);
    })
    console.log('forEach', double);
    console.log('forEach', newArray);   // undefined

    // map, filter, reduce

    // map: unlike forEach, map returns a value by adding each iteration result as part of new array
    const mapArray = array.map((num) => num * 2);
    console.log('map', mapArray)

    // filter: only include the element of array as it iterate and meets the condition
    const filterArray = array.filter((num) => num > 5);  // only elements that is greater than 5
    console.log('fiter', filterArray);

    // reduce: can do a filter and map at the same time
    const reduceArray = array.reduce((accumulator, num) => {return accumulator + num}, 3);  // 3 is a starting accumulator - 0 is default if left out
    console.log('reduce', reduceArray);

    /* 
    Yes, you can indeed use the reduce method to achieve similar results as map and filter. The reduce method is very 
    versatile and can be used to transform and filter elements in an array by accumulating a result.
    
    Here's a quick overview:

    Mapping with reduce: You can use reduce to create a new array with transformed values, similar to map.

    ```
    const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const mappedArray = array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
    accumulator.push(currentValue * 2); // Transformation logic (e.g., multiply by 2)
    return accumulator;
    }, []);
    console.log(mappedArray); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    ```
    
    Filtering with reduce: You can also use reduce to create a new array with filtered values, similar to filter.

    ```
    const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const filteredArray = array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
    if (currentValue % 2 === 0) { // Filtering logic (e.g., keep even numbers)
      accumulator.push(currentValue);
    }
    return accumulator;
    }, []);
    console.log(filteredArray); // Output: [2, 4]
    ```
    
    Combining map and filter with reduce: You can combine the logic of both map and filter in a single reduce operation.
    ```
    const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const mappedAndFilteredArray = array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
    if (currentValue % 2 === 0) { // Filtering logic (e.g., keep even numbers)
      accumulator.push(currentValue * 2); // Transformation logic (e.g., multiply by 2)
    }
    return accumulator;
    }, []);
    console.log(mappedAndFilteredArray); // Output: [4, 8]
    ```
    
    In the third example, reduce is used to first filter out the odd numbers and then transform the even numbers by multiplying them by 2.
    By using reduce, you have more control and can combine multiple operations in a single pass over the array. This can be more efficient in certain scenarios.
